# experiments
html, js, and css experiments! for fun and learning

Note on licenses: The license found in the root folder of this repository is intended to cover the HTML, CSS, and Javascript ("Code") hosted here.
The fonts have their own, seperate license and readme regarding that license.
Image files may eventually have their own license, but there are no image files contained in the repository at the time of writing, so this license has not been added yet.
The license will likely be updated as I figure this out.
